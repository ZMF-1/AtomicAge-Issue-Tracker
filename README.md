# ⚠THE MOD IS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND THE URANIUM ORE-RELATED CONTENT HAS BEEN FINISHED.⚠

## Theme core
Against the backdrop of the explosion of nuclear energy technology in the mid-20th century, the "Atom Punk" technology tree is built on the original redstone system of MC, and 50 new technology blocks such as uranium ore smelting, particle collider, and nuclear power plant are added to realize the deep integration of energy revolution and industrial automation gameplay.

## Featured System
### Radioactive mechanism:
The introduction of Geiger counters and protective clothing equipment.

### Chain Reaction: 
Nuclear reactors have threshold settings, and improper operation can lead to block-level explosion events

### Quantum technology: 
Ender pearls can be synthesized with radioactive materials to create short-range quantum teleportation devices
